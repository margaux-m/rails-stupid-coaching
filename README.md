# Stupid Coaching App

The Stupid Coaching App is a simple Rails application with 2 pages:

- The first page is a form with an input, where a user can type a question to ask the coach
- After submitting the form, the user is redirected to another page where they will see their question and the coach answer.

Done during my time at Le Wagon.
